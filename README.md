# Scenario

This Project is an interview coding challenge. We have provided these starter files to serve as a starting point. You are not required to use these files if you are more comfortable starting your own project or working in a different framework.

## Challenge:

We have provided the initial structure for a TODO list. Most components have been pre-wired for you. We expect you to:
<ol>
  <li>finish writing the task-update component</li>
  <li>implement the updateTask function inside task.service.ts</li>
  <li>implement a put route on the backend in the app.ts file</li>
</ol> 

## Getting Started

We have provided Dockerfiles and a docker-compose file for the project. To start the project using docker (assuming you have installed it and docker-compose), in the directory where you find this README, use the command 'docker-compose up --build'. Once the containers are built and running, you will be able to view the project at 'http://localhost:4200' in your browser. To stop the containers, you may use Ctrl + C in the terminal where you started them. Then run the command 'docker-compose down' to remove the containers from your docker daemon.
